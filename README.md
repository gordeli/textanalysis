# Fundamentals of Text Processing for User Generated Content
Here you will find the teaching materials for the **"Fundamentals of Text Processing for User Generated Content"** part of the course "Customer Intelligence" at EDHEC Business School, 2021

## What is the course about?
The course is designed as an introduction to the basics of natural language processing for analyzing unstructured, user-generated content. It is for beginners to the topic (and NLP in general), but it will be helpful to have basic knowledge of Python and a familarity with data science techniques. 

Topics covered include:
- text preprocessing in Python,
- collecting your own data from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/),
- content analysis,
- text embeddings, and
- supervised learning with text data.

## What materials are available here?
The sildes will be posted on the course BlackBoard page. They mostly serve as a high-level introduction to the examples and exercies (in Colab notebooks), which are linked to from the slides themselves. Copies of the Colab notebooks can also be found in the [folder called /colab](https://github.com/gordeli/textanalysis/tree/master/colab) in this repository.

## Can I work through the material on my own?
If you didn't attend the class, you can certainly work through the materials on your own (the Colab notebooks are designed to be readable and doable for individuals working at their own pace). The slides posted on BlackBoard will guide you through the content. The notebooks are intendend to be worked through *in order*. Each one will have examples to view and 1 or 2 practice exercises to complete.

## Aknowledgements
I would like to aknowledge [Steve Wilson at University of Edinburgh](https://steverw.com) for making the original course publically available with an MIT license.
